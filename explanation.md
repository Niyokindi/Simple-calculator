# Program explanation

In the program, a varialble "x" is assigned to a method "add", which takes two numbers as parameters and returns the sum of the two numbers. We print "x" to display the sum of the two parameters on the console.

A varialble "y" is also assigned to a method "subtract", which takes two numbers as parameters and returns the difference of the two numbers. We print "y" to display the difference of the two parameters on the console.

The tests ran check that the two methods respectively return the correct sum and difference when run
